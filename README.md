## Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker and docker-compose installed and operational. Tip: if `docker version` and `docker-compose version` both run without errors, you're probably good to go.
1. Ensure you have the `aws-cli` installed and configured with your AWS credentials (see `aws configure`). Verify installation with `aws --version`.
1. Ensure you have the `sam-cli` tool installed. Verify installation with `sam --version`.
